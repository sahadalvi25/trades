 # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lottie/
    - assets/videos/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: TestTiemposFine
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/TestTiemposFine-Semibold.otf
          weight: 600
    - family: Ivy-Presto-Text
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ivy-Presto-Text-Bold.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ivy-Presto-Text-Semi-Bold.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ivy-Presto-Text-Light.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ivy-Presto-Text-Thin.otf
    - family: UberMove
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/UberMove-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

          weight: 400
